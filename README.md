## Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game

Goal:
- Develop a text-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer.
- Implement core JavaScript concepts including functions, conditional logic, and variables.

Game Logic:
- getComputerChoice(): Randomly returns "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
- getPlayerChoice(): Prompts the user for their choice and returns it.
- checkWinner(): Determines the winner of a round and returns it.
- playRound(playerChoice, computerChoice): Takes return value of checkWinner(), and displays round result.
- game(): Plays five rounds, keeps track of scores, and declares the final winner.
